      "Before using Fatto Per Dei’s soap in combination with the body butter my skin was horrible. Oily and dry, always broke out, couldn’t find a balance in body care. The soap got rid of the oily skin, helped clear blemishes. But the body butter! My dry uneven skin is no more! It’s amazing, after washing the makeup off, after a long day of work. The butter is perfect for moisturizing! It’s not harsh, it doesn’t irritate, won’t sit on top of your skin. Helps scars and scabs during the drying part of healing. And it has 100% helped with the scarring I have on my face and skin. It’s amazing for all skin types! I cannot express it enough. This miracle body butter knows no bounds. Take the risk and try it! I promise you will not be disappointed! I’ve purchased some to give to my friends, family and coworkers. I haven’t gotten one bad review yet! I’m a proud user of their products and I will happily tell anyone and everyone about Fatto Per Dei!!! I recommend them 10/10!!!",
